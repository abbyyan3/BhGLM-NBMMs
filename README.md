# BhGLM: Bayesian hierarchical GLMs and survival models, with application to Genetics and Epidemiology 

Description: Functions for setting up and fitting various Bayesian hierarchical models, for numerically and graphically summarizing the fitted models, and for evaluating the predictive performance. The functions can be used to analyze not only general data but also large-scale genomic data (i.e., genetic association analysis, predictive and prognostic modeling of diseases and traits).
